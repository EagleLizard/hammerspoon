# Overview
Collection of [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) scripts I use.

## Prerequisites

* MacOS
* Hammerspoon installed

## Getting Started

It's recommended to use this in conjunction with [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) configured with a hyperkey. I mapped `CAPS LOCK` to `CTRL+OPT+CMD+Shift`

The only dependency Spoon is [SpoonInstall](http://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/SpoonInstall.html). Once installed, it should load the rest.

## Hotkeys

`HK` is used as a shorthand for HyperKey, as referenced above.

| Hotkey | Function |
|-|-|
| HK + J | Inserts human readable date time at the top of a Google Doc as a Heading 2. E.g., `Fri. Jan 5th, 2024` |
| HK + N | Inserts a new timestamp at the top of a Google Doc, under the first line/header, in 12h `HH:MM` format (e.g., `3:46 PM:`). Inserts a new line and tab |
| HK + D | Inserts a date string in `MM/DD/YYYY` format at the current text cursor position, e.g., `01/05/2024` |
